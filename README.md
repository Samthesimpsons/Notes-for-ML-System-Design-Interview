This are my notes from bytebytego course on Machine Learning System Design Interview.

There is a book on Software Engineering one, however I am not reading up on that. However I am reading up on NeetCode System Design Course nevertheless. Bought both premium memberships.

I have even expanded on them to add MLOps items from my own work experience.
